Details regarding the technical solution on how we configured Watsons Assistant to enable Core capabilities. 

- Some examples of Key capabilities are:
    - Conversational Interface: AskFinance allows users to query ERP system data through natural language conversations, enabling easy access to financial information.
    - LLM-driven Financial Trend Analysis: Powered by watsonx.ai LLMs, AskFinance analyzes financial data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies, providing actionable insights for informed decision-making.
    - Budget Planning Assistance: AskFinance assists with budget planning by providing predictive analytics and scenario planning, enabling controllers to make data-driven decisions.
- Some example questions are:
    - How did total revenue evolve from Q1 2020 to Q4 2023?
    - Could you please help analyze how consistent the revenue growth was from 2020 to 2023
    - Were there any quarters where expenses exceeded revenue, leading to a net loss?
    - Are we seeing a spike in travel costs compared to 2021 and 2022?
    - Based on the last 3-year trend expenses compared to revenue (2020-2022), what should be the travel and expense budget to consider for fall planning in 2025?

## Build Custom Extensions
To enable AI conversations with financial data, we'd need to configure the Watson Discovery custom extension to access to data corpus and configure the watsonx.ai custom extension to leverage LLM capabilties.

### Create Watson Discovery Custom Extension

1. Once created, in your assistant, navigate to "Integrations" page.
1. Click "Build custom extensions" -> click "Next" -> Input Extension name `Watson Discovery` -> click "Next"
1. Download the Watson Discovery OpenAPI json file: [watson-discovery-query-openapi.json](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/blob/master/integrations/extensions/starter-kits/watson-discovery/watson-discovery-query-openapi.json) and import file to WA. This file contains the configuration to enable accessing to watson discovery from watsonx assistant.
1. click "Next" -> click "Finish"
1. Lower Right corner of the Watson Disovery extension, click "Add" -> click "Add" -> click "Next"
   ![](assets/screenshots/Add_custom_extensions.png)
1. In Authentication page, in the Authentication type dropdown, select "Basic auth"
   1. For Username enter `apikey`
   1. For password and discovery_url, within IBM Cloud -> resource list -> click on you Watson Discovery Instance
   1. You'd see the following view.
      1. Copy **API Key** and paste it in _Password_ field.
      1. Copy **URL** and paste it in _discovery_url_ and remove `https://` from the beginning of the string
         ![](assets/screenshots/watson_discovery_credentials.png)
1. Click "Next", click "Finish", click "Close"

### Create watsonx.ai Custom Extension

1.  In your assistant, navigate to Integrations page, click "Build custom extension" -> click "Next" -> Input Extension name `watsonx.ai` -> click "Next" .
1.  download json file: [watsonx-openapi.json](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-toolkit/blob/master/integrations/extensions/starter-kits/language-model-watsonx/watsonx-openapi.json) and import file to WA
1.  click "Next" -> click "Finish"
1.  Lower Right corner of the watsonx extension, click "Add" -> click "Add" -> click "Next"
1.  In Authentication page, in the Authentication type dropdown, select "OAuth 2.0"
    1. For Apikey, create and copy a new API key from [API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys)
    1. For Server variables, select the region that matches where your environment is configured in.
1.  Click "Next", click "Finish", click "Close"
1.  Your Extensions section will appear as following screenshot once both Watson Discovery and watsonx.ai custom extensions were configured.
